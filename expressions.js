//This sheet will review expressions in Python and JavaScript: 

//Condition: less than
//Python: <
//JavaScript: <

//Condition: greater than
//Python: >
//JavaScript: >

//Condition: less than or =
//Python: <=
//JavaScript: <=

//Condition: greater than or = 
//Python: >=
//JavaScript: >=

//Condition: equality 
//Python: ==
//JavaScript: ==

//Condition: strict equality
//Python: is
//JavaScript: ===

//Condition: inequality
//Python: !=
//JavaScript: !==

//Moral of the lesson -- Use the "strict equality" and "strict inequality"
//operators whenever possible.Javascript is particularly loose about data types, 
//happily coercing (changing) a data from one type to another to compare it 
//in an expression. 
//i.e.: In Javascript, "42" == 42 (but "42" !== 42)
